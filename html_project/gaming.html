            <p>Gaming has been one of my main hobbies for as long as I can remember. From watching my older brothers play horror games and playing SNES at my grandmother's at a very young age, to today watching my favorite Twitch streamers and YouTubers play an array of games, as well as playing my Xbox from my couch most nights.</p>
            <p>Allow me to tell you about my favorite games and content creators</p>
